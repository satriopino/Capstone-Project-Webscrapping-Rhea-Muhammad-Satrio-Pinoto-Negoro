# Web-Scrapping using Beautifulsoup
Web scraping, also known as web harvesting or web data extraction, is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. It involves fetching a web page and extracting data from it. The data can be parsed, searched, reformatted, and copied into a spreadsheet or loaded into a database. Web scraping can be done manually, but in most cases, automated tools are preferred as they can be less costly and work at a faster rate. Web scraping is used for various purposes, including lead generation, price monitoring, market research, and content aggregation. However, some websites use methods to prevent web scraping, such as detecting and disallowing bots from crawling their pages. In response, there are web scraping systems that rely on using techniques in DOM parsing, computer vision, and natural language processing to simulate human browsing to enable gathering web page content for offline parsing.
